A higher education teacher proposed an experiment to develop a predictive model that would use the hours dedicated by students to their studies to anticipate the grades obtained in the final assessments of the subject. To do this, he compiled data on the time spent studying and the results of the exams of a group of students from previous semesters.

From this, he concluded that the most effective approach to solving this problem would be to create a linear regression Machine Learning algorithm.

In this way, the model would be able to learn from the historical data collected and predict the likely results based on a new student`s hours of study by a new student.
